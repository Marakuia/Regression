# Regression
### Description
Neural network for solving the regression problem <br/>
In this problem, the input of the neural network is a data set representing the coordinates along the y-axis. According to these coordinates, it is necessary to predict the coordinates of the x-axis. <br/>
Loss function is root mean square error (MSE) <br/>
After training, the root mean square error on the validation data is 0.96. <br/>

### Results
Dependence of the loss function on the epoch number <br/>

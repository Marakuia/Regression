# Regression
Neural network for solving the regression problem
In this problem, the input of the neural network is a data set representing the coordinates along the y-axis. According to these coordinates, it is necessary to predict the coordinates of the x-axis.
Loss function is root mean square error (MSE)
After training, the root mean square error on the validation data is 0.96.
